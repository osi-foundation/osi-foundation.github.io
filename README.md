# Open Source Investigation Foundation

# Who and What is OSI?

OSI is simply a non-profit project with only one goal: sharing information, and not just any information; accurate information. OSI currently consists of one main person who does everything from research to voice acting, but OSI also approves "guest" writers and researchers.

# How do we work?

When OSI is creating something, whether that would be a video essay or an article, we create a new Github repository, which acts as an open source investigation in which we state the sources we are currently researching, whilst letting people commit their own findings to their own [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) in the repository.

# About Sponsorships

We simply don't take any, with absolutely no exceptions. We have no interest in monetary gain, as our only interest is helping people by sharing information, or just discussing topics ignored by many. But we do offer free help with research and writing to projects of any kind and size, from YouTube video essays to research papers, on a simple condition; The project's interest is sharing accurate information.
