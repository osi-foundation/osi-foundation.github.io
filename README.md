# Open Source Investigation Foundation

# Who and What is OSI?

OSI is simply a non-profit project with only one goal: sharing information, and not just any information; accurate information.

# How do we work?

When OSI is creating something, whether that would be a video essay or an article, we create a new Github reposity, which acts as an open source investigation in which we state the sources we are currently researching, whilst letting people commit their own findings to their own [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) in the repository.
